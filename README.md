# NS-1.1-Plugins
4 plugins with a HUGE amount of customization ability.

Current plugins are as follows:

- Welcome message (toggleable, customizable)

- Return command (admin command, for RDM and whatnot)

- Flag Assignment for addons (toggleable, customizable)

- Government commands (hugely customizable, makes governing RP servers WAY easier.)

Any plugins you may need help with, contact me via discord.
